# Adaptive-gradient-method-from-L_0-to-L-infnity
This package is designed for the paper titled "The effect of network size and regularization function on residual neural networks with an application to genomic prediction". 

It is utilized to facilitate adaptive proximal gradient methods using ResNets with various regularizers for high-dimensional genomic datasets, including mice data, pig data, wheat data. Regularizer included: L_0, L_1/2, L_2/3, MCP, SCAD, L_1, L_4/3, L_3/2, L_2, L_3, L_4, L_infty. 

The datasets used in this research work: mice data, pig data, and wheat data. Because the pig data is bigger than other two datasets and limited space, it is not possible for us to put all the datasets together. If you need, you can access this data use the link here: https://github.com/angelYHF/Pig-data.
